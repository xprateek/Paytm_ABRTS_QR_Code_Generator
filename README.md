  - QR sizes and error‚Äëcorrection levels
  - Optional presets
- Custom dropdowns with animated chevrons; keyboard friendly.
- Light/Dark/System theme via CSS variables.

## Demo

Build locally or deploy using the instructions below. After building, serve dist/ from any static host or run the provided Docker image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (or Docker)
- npm

### Install & Run (Development)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173
```

### Build (Production)
```bash
npm run build
# output in dist/
```

### Lint/Format config (input.json)
```bash
npm run format:input
# pretty-prints public/input.json
```

## Configuration

The application loads settings from public/input.json.

Example:
```json
{
  "sizes": [
    { "label": "Small (128x128)", "value": 128 },
    { "label": "Medium (256x256)", "value": 256 },
    { "label": "Large (512x512)", "value": 512 }
  ],
  "errorCorrections": [
    { "label": "Low (L)", "value": "L" },
    { "label": "Medium (M)", "value": "M" },
    { "label": "Quartile (Q)", "value": "Q" },
    { "label": "High (H)", "value": "H" }
  ],
  "presets": [
    {
      "name": "A-BRTS Station A",
      "text": "Blank Data",
      "size": 512,
      "ecl": "H"
    },
    {
      "name": "A-BRTS Station B",
      "text": "Blank Data",
      "size": 512,
      "ecl": "H"
    },
    {
      "name": "A-BRTS Station C",
      "text": "Blank Data",
      "size": 512,
      "ecl": "H"
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes:
- If parsing or schema validation fails, an error banner appears and safe defaults load so the UI remains usable.
- Update stations under "stations". Validate/format via npm run format:input.

## Theming

- ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù in the header toggles Light/Dark/System.
- All colors are driven by CSS variables on the root .app element.
